How to start
----------------------------
start from creating a GitHub account if you don't have one yet.

 - https://github.com/join

 Second step would be to 'fork' this github repository to your github account, that can be found in the top right corner,(see the example as image below). This will effectively make a current copy of this repository.

Now, you are a proud owner of the forked repository. Next step is to download this repository on your personal computer (aka clone) and create a local copy. to do so, open terminal and change directory to the location where you want to have the repository. To clone the repository type 'git clone https://github.com/{YOUR-GITHUB-NAME}/github-practice-template'

How to run unit tests
---------------------

The repository is set up so you can run unit tests to test the codes. The location of the test is in ./github_practice_tempalte/tests

to run the tests you need to
a) change directory to the local repository directory
b) just type 'pytest' in the terminal
Note: install pytest if it is not available.

see terminal example (if you are in the right directory)
